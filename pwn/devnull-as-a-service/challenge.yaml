  You've heard of /dev/null as a service; now get ready for
  /dev/null as a service, enterprise edition! Our custom
  proprietary glibc (don't sue us) guarantees that your
  data will be securely lost with no chance of being stolen
  or leaked, 100% of the time.

  You can send your shells to `/tmp/stdout`; see `run` for more
  info. This challenge has a large POW to discourage brute force.
  Please play nice! Test locally and don't try to circumvent
  the POW.
