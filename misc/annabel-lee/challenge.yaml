  sounds from a kingdom by the sea

  The server does not produce any visible output; please take a close look
  at what it is sending before asking if the server is broken.

  What exactly _is_ the server sending? Sometimes it makes a sound,
  sometimes it doesn't. Plotting it on a chart might help you see something.

  It might be helpful to turn your sound on, but you'll probably want to
  write all of it down since your terminal might not catch everything fast
  enoughâ€”maybe slow it down to get a better idea.

  This is not audio steganography. Apologies if anyone went down that route.
